TrackCloud TM (alternatively TrackHub TM)

Collaboration Tool - 
Github inspired Hub

To be integrated into Containa.

TODO:

- ZIP Folder 
- #tag rel links to display single Track and autoload related folder/song*set
	[-is possibly only functional in callbacks... got to find a way]
- A REL to playerView links
- Overlay CSS for playerView & tracksList
- Share Link

Backlog:

- Integrate playerView into tracksList
- All Tracks SYNC_playback (Master Time)
- Uploader
- Song*Set Modi: 
 - 1. LIST: align tracks behind each under (unlimited amount of tracks)
 - 2. MIX: align tracks underneath (limit to 8 tracks for performance)
- CRON Job MP3 conversion for faster prelistening on demand. (conversion widget)

Environment Considerations:
- Write Ajax to S3 Server, for file storage...

Security Bugs:

- integrate error handling to folder.json loader
